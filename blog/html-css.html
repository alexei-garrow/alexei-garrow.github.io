          What is the difference between Margin, Border and Padding?
        </h1>
        <p>
          People including myself get confused with this stuff, mainly because
          padding and margin both involve space around the element. Padding is
          the space between the element and it's border. Margin is the space
          between the outside and the border. So what does that actually mean?
          Thankfully some smart people came up with a way to illustrate this!

        <h2 class="center">Introducing the Box Model!</h2>
        <img
          class="responsive-img"
          src="/img/boxmodel.png"
          alt="A picture of a box model"
        />
      </div>
      <div class="item3">
        <p class="center">
          As you can see the
          <a
            class="underline"
            target=".black"
            href="https://web.dev/learn/css/box-model"
            ><strong>box model</strong></a
          >
          is a picture representing all the things we are discussing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The content in the box model could be anything from a div to your
          paragraph. As you can now see the padding is illustrated as the space
          between the element and it's border. It should be noted that padding,
          border and margin are 4 directional, and you can use any combination
          you'd like.

          So how can we use these things?! With all 3 of these CSS options we
          can use these 4 directives.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Top</li>
          <li>Right</li>
          <li>Bottom</li>
          <li>Left</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          They all have their own syntax for this as this one's a little easier
          to see ( im my opinion ). let's start with the border!
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box1">
        <p>Hey</p>
      </div>
      <div class="item5">
        <p>
          Here we have a box with the eloquent text "Hey". We've given it a
          background color so we can see it's full size, and we've given it a
          red border on the right. To do this in CSS we need to assign it a
          class or id, and then in that class or id add the code: 'border-right:
          5px red solid;'. To break this down we have the target so the border
          then the side in this case -right, we then specify the size and the
          color, finally the type of border, in this case the solid border.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>border-right: 5px red solid;</li>
          <li></li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="item6">
        <p>So what about padding?</p>
        <p>Let's bring back our "Hey" example and take a look!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="box1">
        <p>Hey</p>
      </div>
      <div class="item6">
        <p>Now let's change the left padding by 20%</p>
      </div>
      <div class="box2">
        <p>Hey</p>
      </div>
      <div class="item6">
        <p>Wait, what happened here?! Let's try 10px instead!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="box3">
        <p>Hey</p>
      </div>
    </div>
