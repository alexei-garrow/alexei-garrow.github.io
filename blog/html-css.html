          What is the difference between Margin, Border and Padding?
        </h1>
        <p>
          People including myself get confused with this stuff, mainly because
          padding and margin both involve space around the element. Padding is
          the space between the element and it's border. Margin is the space
          between the outside and the border.
        </p>
        <p>
          So what does that actually mean? Thankfully some smart people came up
          with a way to illustrate this!
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="item2">
        <h2 class="center">Introducing the Box Model!</h2>
        <img
          class="responsive-img"
          src="/img/boxmodel.png"
          alt="A picture of a box model"
        />
      </div>
      <div class="item3">
        <p class="center">
          As you can see the
          <a
            class="underline"
            target="_blank"
            href="https://web.dev/learn/css/box-model"
            ><strong>box model</strong></a
          >
          is a picture representing all the things we are discussing.
        </p>
        <p class="center">
          The content in the box model could be anything from a div to your
          paragraph.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you can now see the padding is illustrated as the space between the
          element and it's border. It should be noted that padding, border and
          margin are 4 directional, and you can use any combination you'd like.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="item4">
        <p>
          So how can we use these things?! With all 3 of these CSS options we
          can use these 4 directives.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Top</li>
          <li>Right</li>
          <li>Bottom</li>
          <li>Left</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          They all have their own syntax. For this example we'll use the border
          first as this one's a little easier to see ( im my opinion ). So let's
          start with the border!
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box1">
        <p>Hey</p>
      </div>
      <div class="item5">
        <p>
          Here we have a box with the eloquent text "Hey". We've given it a
          background color so we can see it's full size, and we've given it a
          red border on the right. To do this in CSS we need to assign it a
          class or id, and then in that class or id add the code: 'border-right:
          5px red solid;'. To break this down we have the target so the border
          then the side in this case -right, we then specify the size and the
          color, finally the type of border, in this case the solid border.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>border-right: 5px red solid;</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="item6">
        <p class="center">So what about padding?</p>
        <p>Let's bring back our "Hey" example and take a look!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="box1">
        <p>Hey</p>
      </div>
      <div class="item5">
        <p>Now let's change the left padding by 20%</p>
        <ul>
          <li>padding-left: 20%;</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="box2">
        <p>Hey</p>
      </div>
      <div class="item5">
        <p>Wait, what happened here?! Let's try 10px instead!</p>
        <ul>
          <li>padding-left: 10px;</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="box3">
        <p>Hey</p>
      </div>
      <div class="item5">
        <p>Ah that's better, can you see it? What if we try 100px!</p>
        <ul>
          <li>padding-left: 100px;</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="box4">
        <p>Hey</p>
      </div>
      <div class="item5">
        <p>
          Ok that's a bit much, it even added some Margin!? But you get the idea
          right?
        </p>
        <p>
          Cool I'm going to set this back to 10px, and now we can play with the
          margin.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the below example I'm going to stick with the left theme, and add
          some left margin.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>padding-left: 10px;</li>
          <li>margin-left: 10%;</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="box5">
        <p>Hey</p>
      </div>
      <div class="item5">
        <p>Ok did you notice? What if we bring it in, both sides by 10%!!</p>
        <ul>
          <li>margin-left: 10%;</li>
          <li>margin-right: 10%;</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="box6">
        <p>Hey</p>
      </div>
      <div class="item5">
        <p>
          Ok did you notice how both sides came in, but balanced out? Meaning it
          was less on the left than the above example, even though they were the
          same %?
