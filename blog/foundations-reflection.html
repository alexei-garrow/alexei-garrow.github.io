        <h4>
          What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
          due to the core learning?
        </h4>
        <p>
          1. I'd say I learned that even though I think of myself as not having
          an ego, perhaps although there's alot of truth to that. To expand on
          that, the idea of me not liking being bad at something, especially
          something I want to excel at and or am putting the time into, could be
          considered ego depending on ones perspective.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. I learnt that I hadn't really thought about values, really I've
          always thought about perspectives, beliefs etc, but not values. Though
          values are really beliefs meeting action right ( even though you could
          argue that is belief as well, or what is action etc.) that was
          interesting to me, trying to seperate the two aspects and really dig
          into them. I have learnt a lot about core stuff in general but this is
          probably one of the more bias heavy interactions I had in core skills.
          I had to check my ideals or ego ( I really don't like that term ) at
          the door so to speak.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. I would say I enjoyed mindfullness far more than I expected to. I
          alsomlike values, brought in the still contested idea, what is the
          difference between medidtation and mindfullness? yes there are some
          etc, but it seems to depend on the activity etc. Whilst meditation cna
          be an action a set period of time, mindfullness seems to be not just
          the action of that meditation like app, but also a state of mind, and
          a gentle reminder when things are getting tough. A way to get into a
          more open mindspace that will help you to learn faster etc.
        </p>
        <h4>
          What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
          and programming?
        </h4>
        <p>
          I think the roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness are to not
          only your fellow programmers peers coachs etc, but to yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are there to really define and shape not only you as a person,
          but you as a workmate, a colleague and maybe a friend.
        </p>
        <p>
          Values not only give you a way to view things, and a way to act, they
          also give people a way to relate and connect with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Empathy not only helps you be more mindful of other people and their
          circomstances, it also helps you intteract with yourself in a better
          manner. We've all heard the saying treat yourself as you would like
          others to be treated, whilst there's a lot of truth to this, the
          reality is thin gs are not so black and white. You can learn more
          about other people through empathy, and then cater your intteractions
          around that inforamtion, the truth is the best for you isn't always
          the best for others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Self-awareness plays into all of these things, I'd argue they're all (
          values, empathy and self-awareness) connected. Without self-awareness
          can you really have values? Or atleast outline ones you'd like to have
          / live by? Can you empathise with others if you can't with yourself
          maybe, but I think there would be a limit, although this could also be
          bias or ego talking?
        </p>
        <p>
          The true aspect of selfawareness though, is knowing what you are doing
          how you are treating people how you are acting. You can find out is
          you're being hypocritical etc.
        </p>
        <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
        <p>
          How much of a needed refresher it was on some of these subjects. I can
          see why some people don't like it. I honestly got way more out of it
          than I expected, even though I knew some of the things already, the
          reminder was fantastic, and made me realise I should probably review
          this stuff more often than a few times I'd learnt about it.
        </p>
        <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
        <p>
          I found the introduction quite full on, I don't really enjoy them
          honeslty. I think the challenging aspects were really mindset things,
          making sure a gave things a proper fair shot before carrying my biases
          into it. For me that wasn't too difficult, but it still was a thing
          sometimes.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
          focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
        </h4>
        <p>
          I think as you state, it's something employers look for, it probably
          also helps to have graduates who interract with people and employers
          well, to not only promote the brand and community, but to make the
          instructors proud.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we are to realistically look at this course over the time spent
          etc, you aren't going to be able to learn all the programming you're
          going to need for a job, but you're going to learn enough to get a
          food in the door, and to teach yourself as you go. I think this makes
          core skills even more of a valuable asset to this course, as tnhis
          will help seperate you from the crowd.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste
          of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
          instead? Justify your answer.
        </h4>
        <p>
          I think learning things like mindfullness epsecially for people like
          me (over 25) is super helpful for helping you get into the zone. I
          need to read more on those studies mind you :) haha.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also think very closely linked to that, learning about
          neuroplasticity is a fantastic thing, and as shown by evidence can
          actually imporve people just by knowing of it's existence.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thought it was a good balance honestly, and sometimes a good way to
          process a sprint / and or gear up for the next one. Sometimes it's
          good to get your head out of the code base, and take a look around.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would also add, from my understanding you're going to have to do
          stuff like this at a lot of companies whether you enjoy it or not. So
          we need to get used to not being able to focus on programming 100% of
          our time. For better or worse.
