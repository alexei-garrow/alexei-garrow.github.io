      <h3>A time I was blocked on a simple problem!</h3>
      <article>
        <h4>What was the problem?</h4>
        <p>
          It was the 'fire fire' problem when I was trying to execute a string
          rather than print my parameter. Basically I got the answer completely
          wrong.
        </p>
        <h4>what problem-solving techniques did you use?</h4>
        <p>
          I tried various debugging, reading aloud, rubberducky (my non
          programming friends, it's perfectly normal to talk about rubberducks!)
          and looking up terms. Finally I asked for help in the tech-questions
          discord channel, where a couple instructors helped me see some
          fundimental missunderstandings!
        </p>
        <h4>How did you feel throughout the process?</h4>
        <p>
          A mixture of emotions, from frustration, to confusion, to a real sense
          of humilty and humbleness, lol. I honestly felt kinda dumb, but that's
          ok. We all have these moments, especially when coding!
        </p>
        <h4>What did you learn?</h4>
        <p>
          I learned I didn't necessarily understand the problem. Particularly
          when I was trying to work it out. At the time I didn't get the
          lightbulb moment that I did later, when I realised it didn't matter
          what the parameter was (ie I didn't need to set it's data type) only
          what it actually did. We then expect the correct input in terms of in
          this case, a string.
        </p>

      <h3>A time I elegantly solved a problem.</h3>
      <article>
        <h4>What was the problem?</h4>
        <p>The first fizzbuzz problem!</p>
        <h4>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h4>
        <p>
          I used the if else method to solve this problem. The main part was
          checking the syntax, I actually knew what solution to impliment for a
          change. So I googled and watched a youtube video on how to create if
          else to double check the syntax.
        </p>
        <h4>How did you feel throughout the process?</h4>
        <p>
          I felt really happy, like elated when I solved the problem. Like, it
          was kind of over kill how good I felt!
        </p>
        <h4>What did you learn?</h4>
        <p>
          I learn't about a feeling I'd like to feel more often not only could I
          do this, but doing it felt great!
        </p>

      <h3>
        Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving
        techniques/processes:
      </h3>
      <article>
        <h4>Pseudocode</h4>
        <p>
          I'm getting better with this. I like the idea s a whole, and can see
          how it's super useful, persoanlly, and for other people using /
          viewing your code!
        </p>
        <h4>Trying something</h4>
        <p>
          I had a couple mildly scary momnets when I thought I'd broken the
          programme by putting in like well 'bad code', haha! Thankfully it
          didn't take me too long to realise it wasn't the end of the world! I
          also, think it's going to be super helpful going forward especially
          with console.log etc. It will also help the tutors see my process etc,
          to understand if I'm getting things wrong on a fundamental or
          technical level etc.
        </p>
        <h4>Rubber ducky method</h4>
        <p>
          I like this one, and have used it a lot more. I've also found for me
          if I start writing down stuff, it has a similar affect. For example I
          will pretend to write to a facilitator etc, but actually type to
          myself then talk it through my question 'the question' etc.
        </p>
        <h4>Reading error messages</h4>
        <p>
          This worked well for the first few Kata's and I really enjoyed it!
          Later on though, it was less helpful, as you really needed to build
          whole bits of code to really make it work ( unless I've got that
          completely wrong? ). I'd like to get more comfortable with this stuff,
          and have found
          <a
            class="hover current underlined"
            target="_blank"
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors"
            >this</a
          >
          which should hopefully help!!
        </p>
        <h4>Console.logging</h4>
        <p>
          I need to do more of this! It's super useful, and I think as I get
          better with the basics it will prove even more useful to me!
        </p>
        <h4>Googling</h4>
        <p>
          I'm definitely getting a lot of practice with this one, hahah! I'm
          finding some good stuff too. Thought I still find youtube better a lot
          of the time. There was some very helpful advice on the methods page
          for goolging, and about where to look as well which was great!
        </p>
        <h4>Asking your peers for help</h4>
        <p>
          I've asked a few people for help over the past couple of weeks. I've
          found the looping sessions really good for little hints etc as well,
          and talking through, realising I'm not the only one struggling etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          There's a certain person though codename joel.a who has saved me on
          more than one occasion!
        </p>
        <h4>Asking coaches for help</h4>
        <p>
          I'm good with this most of the time, though I don;t like asking if
          I;ve fallen behind, as it feels like a giant spotlight on where I'm
          at. Even though I know they will or can just check my github etc
          anyway..
        </p>
        <h4>Improving your process with reflection</h4>
        <p>
          I'm really enjoying this process, and from the further research into
          neuroplasticity etc, it's reinforced even more how useful this skill
          is to develop!
        </p>

      <h3>
        Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made
        you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
      </h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          It's mainly been when I've fallen beheind. There have been a couple of
          occasions when I've also been embarrased ( ashamed and annoyed ), but
          I have pushed through these feeling when I've really needed to!
