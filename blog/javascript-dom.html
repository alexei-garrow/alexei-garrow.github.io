          <strong>HTML</strong> is short for hyper text markup
          <a
            class="hover current"
            target="_blank"
            href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp"
            >language</a
          >. In essence what this means is HTML is the skeleton, the bones of
          the website. In our example below it is the plans, and the literal
          structure of the spaceship! Though thankfully unlike if we forget to
          add something to the space ship, it isn't a huge deal with our
          website, we can just edit the code!

          <strong>CSS</strong> is short for cascading style
          <a

            >sheets</a
          >. CSS is more than just the color (colour) or font, CSS is also about
          positioning where do you want things? In our spaceships case CSS has
          more to do with the look of the spaceship. Making sure it looks like a
          USS spaceship could prevent conflicts, therefor 'styling' is
          incredible important here!

          of the web. JavaScript is the interactivity, the programming, the
          Hyperdrive ( spore drive? ). In our example here, javascript is the
          functionality it is the lasers, the shields the spaceship itself in
          action!

          Obviously these examples are a little on silly side, but I trust you
          get the idea? One of the better ways I've seen it summerised was in a
          video we watched earlier in the course. HTML is the builder, CSS the
          stylist / painter, and JavaScript - the wizzard! JavaScript is the
          magic that binds it all together.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's important to consider our roles, as we progress into the
          workforce. We will most likely be junior developers, but what does
          that mean? Well we will be like the builders, but of the the website
          rather than a house. We will use all the tools to construct the
          websites or parts of them we will work on. The magic is not only in
          JavaScript, but in how we use all these tools, and how everything
          binds together.

      <h3 class="center">Control flow</h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          What is control flow? Control flow is a term used to describe the way
          the programming language is run. In this case, by default JavaScrip (
          and most other languages ) run from top to bottom, not unlike when
          reading a book. Control flow is hinted to in it's name, to control the
          flow. When we think of the standard top to bottom control flow though,
          this isn't always ideal. Sometimes we need to do multiple things
          before going to the next thing, just like in real life!
        </p>
        <p class="center small">(see below)</p>
      </article>
      <h3>Loops in control flow</h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          So what is a loop, and how can we demonstrate control flow with it?
          Well firstly we need to get something to run through this loop. In
          this example below I'm going to create an array of ingredients. (I'll
          explain how that works below)
        </p>
        <img
          class="responsive-img main2"
          src="/img/let-ingredients-list.png"
          alt="A list of ingredients"
        />
        <p>
          Here we declare the type of variable it is with the word 'let'. There
          are 2 main types, let and const (constant). We use const for variables
          we don't plan on chaning ( we can change things in the array though!)
          and we use let for a variable we might want to change later.
        </p>
        <p>
          so let and const are the decleration, in this case 'ingredientsList'
          is the variable ( container for holding things like data). In this
          container we will store a type of data called an array. Arrays are
          indexs of data, or arrays of data stored as an index, whatever makes
          more sense to you. To tell it's an array we can see the [] square
          brackets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we have our array we need to store some information in it. In
          this case we need to store a list of ingredients! The way we do this
          is with the '' we put the word inside like 'food' then if we want more
          than one ( hint we should or why use an array!?), we can use a comma ,
          to divide them like so: ['pizza', 'noodles', 'pasta']. We then end the
          line with a simicolon ;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we have our array, we need to loop through it to take all the
          ingredients out and or check they are there!
        </p>
        <img
          class="responsive-img main2"
          src="/img/for-ingredients-list.png"
          alt="an image of a loop"
        />
        <p>
          Ok so what is going on here! First 'for' is the type of loops we then
          tell it what to do in the () brackets. firstly we say 'let i;'' this
          is assigning 'i' as the
          <a
            class="hover current"
            href="https://www.google.com/search?q=iterator&oq=iterator&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDEyMjlqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8"
            >iterator</a
          >
          we then tell it to start from 0 time through the loop. We are then
          giving it a condition, in this case as long as 'i' is less than the
          ingredientsList.length ( the length of our array) it will keep going.
          We then make sure to increase the number our iterator is searching
          through each time it collects data. We do this by assigning 'i' the
          '++' (increment assignment). This increases the iterator, therefor
          increasing the number of the index it is searching through.
        </p>
        <p>
          The iterator starts at the first item of our array ' 0 ' yes 0 it
          starts 0 1 2 3 etc. each time it ++ it goes to the next so 0 loop back
          then 1 loop back etc, then finishes at the end. Thankfully we assigned
          the i less than ingredientsList.length, the main advantage of that is
          not only, not having to remember how long the array is, but also being
          able to add or remove from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can do this with
          <a
            class="hover current"
            target="_blank"
            href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_push.asp"
            >push</a
          >
          and
          <a
            class="hover current"
            target="_blank"
            href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_pop.asp"
            >pop</a
          >
          commands.

      <h3>The DOM</h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          The DOM or document object model, is simply a document that your
          browser creates. Everything inside this document is an object / node.
          JavaScript uses the DOM and it's objects etc, to interract with the
          elements of the page. JavaScript is run in the browser, and this is
          how it's done. JavaScript is brought into the HTML doc through us
          linking our .js file, it them uses the DOM to execute the code.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we were to use an example of how or why we'd use the DOM, there are
          many, from simply changing the style of an element to having an
          interractive button and or form. JavaScrip can technically change
          anything on your website.
        </p>
      </article>
      <h3>Arrays & objects</h3>
      <article>
        <p>So we know what an array is:</p>
        <img
          class="responsive-img main2"
          src="/img/let-ingredients-list.png"
          alt="A list of ingredients"
        />
        <p>But what about an object?</p>
        <img class="responsive main2" src="/img/let-ingredients-object.png" />
        <p>
          Here we have an object, an object is another variable / container.
          Inside this object we have a list of ingredients.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we can see what they both are, let's talk about the
          differences in terms of getting data out of them! For startes objects
          or their properties in this case are group in pairs called the key
          values pairs or pairings. In this case 'flour:'is the 'key' and its
          'value' is '200g'.
        </p>
        <p>
          To get the data out of an array you need to either loop through it or
          pull out a specific index number: console.log(ingredientList[1]); Will
          print out 'flour' to the console ( rememeber they start from 0).
        </p>
        <p>
          To pull out dats of the object we can use a function or we can use the
          . calling method ie: console.log(ingredients.water); WIll give us '1
          litre'
        </p>
      </article>
      <h3>Functions and why we use them</h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          Functions are reuseable sections of code. THey cna be very powerful
          for basic things like adding numbers together. The main benefit to
          this is in parameters like function addition(num1,num2) { return num1
          + num 2; } console.log(addition(1,1)); this will add 1 + 1. The reason
          this is power is we can do this mutiple times throughout the code, we
          can call in that same function with a different arguement
          console.log(addition(200,50)); Without having to rewrite everything!
        </p>
        <p>
          There is something to consider when dealing with functions, and that
          is when you all them! To show an exaggerated example:
        </p>
        <img
          class="responsive-img"
          src="/img/cooking-example1.png"
          alt="a picture of a function with functions inside it"
        />
        <p>Now this all looks good?</p>
        <img
          class="responsive-img"
          src="/img/cooking-example2.png"
          alt="a picture of a function with badly arranged functions inside it"
        />
        <p>
          Wait a second! How do we start cooking without any ingredients? Or
          plateup before we've even cooked? Though pretty exaggerated, this is
          something that can happen with functions. Always be aware of when you
          are calling them!
