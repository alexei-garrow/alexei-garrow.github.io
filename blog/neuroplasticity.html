          <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h3>
          <article>
          <p>
              Sciencetific studys suggest that understanding the principles of neuroplasticity, actually helps people learn better. There seem to be 2 main components.
          <ul>
            <li>Belief / mindset</li>
            <li>Application</li>
          </ul>
          </p><p>
             The belief and mindset are explored in that they teach the people (children in these studies) that your skill and knowledge are not fixed. You can infact improve on these things. 
          </p>
          <p>This delves more into the whole you are what you believe ethos, if you believe something impossible ( even if it is in fact possible) then it will be so, as you will always act as if it is.
          </p>
          <p>That brings us into application. Whilst knowing that we need to fucs to engage the brain, and rest / sleep well to process all this new found knowledge. This can really only take place one you believe it's possible. </p>
          <p>We have the great optional video that was linked of Carol <a class="active hover" target="_blank" href="https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve#t-459099">Dweck</a>. We also have some fantastic videos from the neuroscientist, Dr Andrew <a class="active hover" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cc3dgQxN27Y">Huberman</a></p>

        <h3>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</h3>
        <article>
        <p>
        Neuroplasticity is a fascinating subject, with many subcatogories. Dr Huberman describes Neuroplasticity as:<br><br>
        "Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to change and adapt in response to stimuli over time. On a cellular level, it involves modifying existing synapses, building new connections between neurons, and generating entirely new neurons and neural networks through a process rightly called neurogenesis. Contrary to what was previously believed, brain development does not only occur in childhood — in fact, the adult brain is still capable of self-directed synaptic growth.
        </p><p>
        Psychedelics such as psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) have been studied for their potential to trigger profound reorganization and modulation of neural pathways. Functional changes in brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, facilitate shifts in thought patterns, perceptions, and behaviors which are typically experienced during a psychedelic ‘trip’.
        </p><p>
        Understanding the neuroscience involved in habit formation and behavioral change can increase our chances of success. There is a correlation between the formation of habits and the pursuit and achievement of goals: the likelihood of achieving a goal is strengthened by the reinforcement of daily habits, and making habits stick relies on connecting the new behavior (or abstinence of the behavior) to a bigger purpose or desired outcome.
        </p><p>
        A more profound understanding of neuroplasticity and the human brain not only transforms our perspective on learning and behavioral change, but also how we see ourselves and our potential to change for the better."

        </p>
        <p>To really get the benefit out of it, we need to abide by the pricnciples of the growth mindset, with the focussing intently on subjects we wish to learn, and getting proper rest to digest all this information. 
        </p>
        <p>There have been studies done on focus groups that had 2 groups of similar levels learning a subject, one group were aloud to sleep 6 hours a night, the other 8 hours. In the first couple of weeks it didn't make a huge difference, but by week 3 there was a more significant shift in participants retaining information, this as you can imagine only increased as the study went on, but not by huge amounts.</p>
        <p>The main takaways are how you feel about your self and your learning, will affect your outcomes. Try to eliminate as much negative thought as you can, and get the rest you need.
        </p>
        <p>Instead of saying I can't or this is too difficult etc, say not yet. Reframe your outlook, your lense, and build up your belief in yourself with small incremental <a class="active current" target="_blank" href="https://buffer.com/resources/the-habits-of-successful-people-they-have-a-growth-mindset/">achievements.</a></p>

        <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
       <article>
        <p>We've talked about most of them already, but the main ones invole improving your focus, outlook, and control of your negative emotions, and pysical decline ( i.e get enough rest ). One of the best ways to learn is to repeat, then to resasses, and finally reflect. <p class="small"><em>Almost</em> sounds familiar.. ;P</p>
        </p>

        <h2>Research Growth Mindset</h2>
       <article>
        <p>Growth mindset, is the acknowledgment of the ability of the brain to change, to be able to learn and grown. For you to be able to gather more knowledge and improve your skills.
        </p>
        <p>Growth mindset comes with the opposing mindset of people believing nothing, can change or that they won;t be able to do or learn anything.</p>
        <p>Growth mindset is increadibly relevent, even if not thought of in such terms. Imagine you didn't think you could learn anythong? Why go to university, why learn an instrument, why read a book? The list is endless, although we can debate levels of this, and acknowledge we can all be guilty of having a growth mindset in some areas os our life and not other. There any many industries that would not exist if people didn't believe they could learn, why would we all sign up to this course?</p>

       <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
       <article>
        <p>I knew most if not all of this stuff going in, but it did remind me about some of it. In a way, it's easy to get lost, and forget the basics of this stuff, especially if you're having a rough time with some material. This was a nice revisit for me!
        </p>
       </article>
        <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
       <article>
        <p>I think the journey is the same really, although I will activiely try and incorperate more focussing into my learning. I'm guessing that's kind of the point of doing <a class="active hover underline" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFSc7Ck0Ao0">this</a> before we engage in material though ( particularly for us over 25ers!).
        </p>
        <p>I will use it as a reminder not to be too hard on myself, and something to look back at when I'm struggling. Thankfully I knew a lot of this stuff already, so it is really in my learning plan already. Thought I will probably watch the Huberman videos on habits and focus, as that will help me even more!</p>
