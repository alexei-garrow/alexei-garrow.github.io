      <h3>Taha Tinana (physical wellbeing)</h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          I'm going for a walk 3 times a week, once I'm over my long covid, I'll
          turn this into a run. Eventually I'll get back into shape. Shape for
          me means more health, then like 10 - 15kgs lost (mostly from my
          stomach), though that isn't as important. This ties into the whole 30
          mintues 3 times a week, and the remarkable affect that will have on
          your life.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm slowly building up my physique. I have in the past done very
          intese activities around this. I'm looking for more managable long
          term commitments like yoga, and basic strength training.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm aiming to finally get a good sleep routine, or at least something
          resembling a routine. FOr me personally I seem to need that 7:30 / 8
          hours sleep to properly fuction over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          I try to eat a balanced diet, that also includes some junk food. I'm
          also incorperating fasting into my life a 3 day every quarter of the
          year, and a 1 day every 2 weeks
        </p>
        <p>
          My big focus around physical health is mostly to do with maintainable
          standards, that involves time as well as other aspects. I don;t really
          have 2 hours a day to hit the gym. Well maybe once I get a rotuine
          sorted there could be more options.

      <h3>Taha Whānau (Family Wellbeing)</h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          I'm very lucky to have a lot of great friends. A big goal of mine is
          always trying to catch up with the majority of them at least once a
          year, and just generally reaching out to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a good relationship with most of my direct family, but it could
          always be better. I try to reach out more than just birthdays, I find
          I don't always put enough effort into these relationships though. So
          I'll set the aim / goal of doing more, even if it's just sending a
          random joke or something.
        </p>
        <p>
          A big thing for me is just getting out, whilst I cna be extremely
          extroverted I cna also be the person tha tnever leaves the house,
          balance is a core concept for me in my Taha Whānau ( How do I write
          that a? )
        </p>
        <p>
          The other side of it is eventually wanting to find someone to spend my
          life with, have kids etc. Well, I've got a lot to work on on that
          front, lol.. Maybe a goal can be to put myself out there a bit more.
        </p>
      </article>
      <h3>Taha Hinengaro (Emotional and Mental Wellbeing)</h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          Balance is a key part of this, including eating well, exercising,
          getting enough sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
          Positive self talk, outlook, and perception. I'm working on this more,
          it's difficult for me when I'm not very good at something, it can
          sometimes attach to me as a person, rather than just me as a
          programmer. My aim is to keep these seperate whilst still aiming to
          achieve, and doing this whilst maintaining the healthy outlooks and
          patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have commited ot the guided meditations before bed, and interraction
          with Dev academy material. I also love learning more about psychology,
          neuroscience etc. So I commit to keep looking to keep learning more
          about this stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally something that has always helped me, has been a sense of
          purpose. A goal, a journey etc to chase. I've set my goal. Someone
          with the skills in this area to be able to contract within 5 year.
          More goals follow from there.

      <h3>Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing)</h3>
      <div class="main2">
        <!-- No idea what is going on with these containers..-->
        <article>
          <p>
            This one is a bit more difficult for me. I think mindfullness and
            gratitude fit in well for me here. I am to set aside time every week
            to practice these disciplines.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think like the model suggests, the walls are connected, and for me
            Taha Wairua is enhanced by achieving the other walls. The house
            stands on strong foundations.
          </p>

      <h3>Whenua (Interconnections to the land and environment)</h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          For me I've always felt a connection to running, and swimming in the
          sea. I love the ocean, and never spend anywhere near enough time in
          it. I'd like to tr and get in to swim at least once a month, then try
          to get that to once every fortnight, although I'm not so sure about
          winter.. :P
        </p>
        <p>
          SOmething I've started doing that really helps, is going out for a
          walk at night even if just a quick look down the road, at the starts
          and ocean. It helps clear me head, and put things into perspective.
