      <h3 class="left">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          My long term goal is the same as in foundations. It's to get to the
          point of being able to contract on my terms. I see the career pathway
          as learning through this course, then starting out as a an intern /
          junior developer, learning the ropes and slowly climbing the ladder.
          My main goal is to be good enough to contract within 5 years after
          this course.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm hoping to get a good handle on the basics, and really understand
          as much as I can from the curriculum. In terms of a destination in
          mind after bootcamp? I'd like to apply for the internship program I've
          heard about. I will continue practicing, I will finish the
          freecodecamp course, I will also do the python for everybody course,
          and slowly make my way through the rest of Dr chucks courses. I also
          have a few website projects I've been asked to look at mainly my Dad
          my personal one, potentiallys mMum's as well & even a former business
          partner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course like probably a lot of others I have some app ideas that
          will obviosuly change the world! ( lol! )

      <h3>
        What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
        Bootcamp?
      </h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          Very similarly my strengths and weaknesses are still very similar. I'm
          getting better with the routine, but still have my moments every now
          and then.
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of specifically for bootcamp, my biggest strengths will be my
          core skills, my showing up and giving everything the best I can. My
          limitations will be technical skills, and probably working in an
          office space / adjusting to that vibe. Organization, and sticking to a
          routine.
        </p>
      </article>
      <h3>
        What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
        be?
      </h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          I think staying on top of the material might prove to be a challenge,
          I will obviously put insnae time into this, and have freed up almost
          all of my weekends for this. I've also consulted all my students, and
          may quit teaching them if needs be.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm hoping working in groups won't be too much of a hassle for me, but
          it has been a minute!
        </p>
        <p>
          Speaking in front of groups isn't my forte unless I really know my
          subject, so this will be interesting, but I think I cna do it, and
          will get better at it as we go!
        </p>
        <p>
          I think keeping focussed for 9 weeks might be a challenge as well, the
          big things I will need to keep in mind will be having set end times
          for study. I will need time to chill out, so this will come down to
          organisation as well. I think for me sometimes I need to put the 30 or
          20 minute timer on as well, I cna get really stuck into stuff
          sometimes which is good, but not always time efficient. Sometimes you
          get more done, with the quick breaks even compared to when you're on a
          roll.

      <h3>
        What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          I think communication especially professional communication, could be
          an area for impovment. I will have to see how the teamwork goes, but I
          cna always get better, I'm assuming there could be a lot of room for
          growth with most of this stuff. I'd like to develop some leadership
          skills, and giving feedback, I know there are meany thoughts in this
          area, from the sandwich to the straight up.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think reflection will be very important for all areas, and I look
          forward to imporving this!

      <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          I expect what's expected really, clear communcation, plans and
          expectations.
        </p>
        <p class="small">
          (Truthfully I don't really understand these types of questions, so
          perhaps that's a human skill that I can develop more.)
        </p>
      </article>
      <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
      <p>
        My expectations for myself in bootcamp, in terms of asking for help etc,
        I will ask peers first if I think they can help, if not I will ask
        staff. This is when I can't get the answer within like 10-20 mins of
        self searching etc. I will use staff and peers around me ( staff if they
        are on the clock so to speak) if not I will ask on discord etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        My commitment to managing this workload, is to really get on top of my
        routine, this will be helped by comming into campus, and having the 8:45
        am check ins.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will work in a respectful, professional, empathetic and productive
        manner. I will stick to time boxes / suggested timeframes, and allocate
        time near the end of the day / week to catch up on what I need to. I
        will be taking notes on things I need to dig deeper into etc, and
        bringing up stuff I'm struggling with in my 1 on 1's.

      <div><h1>My Foundations learning plan</h1></div>
      <h3 class="left">My Goal</h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          My long term goal is to get to the point of being able to contract on
          my terms. I see the career pathway as learning through this course,
          then starting out as a an intern / junior developer, learning the
          ropes and slowly climbing the ladder. My main goal is to be good
          enough to contract within 5 years after this course.
        </p>
      </article>
      <h3>My strengths and limitations</h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          My strengths when it comes to learning, are mainly around the goals
          and motivation of wanting to learn this stuff, bringing a dedication
          and commitment. I can analyse things to a certain extent, I'm hoping
          this will help me learn things faster, and on a deeper level.
        </p>
        <p>
          My limitations when it comes to learning are primarily about time
          management, self discipline, and routine. I have lot's of room to
          grown with time management / scheduling etc. I have strong self
          discipline, but when it's related to routine or keeping one, I am more
          lax than I should be.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main thing is routine, this is my biggest hurdle, creating new
          habits and keeping them. Life for me has never had a truly set
          routine, it's always changed depending on what I was doing. There is
          always the posibility of a last minute call, a gig with a late start /
          end time. That won't change as much, but the main factor is developing
          a consistent circadian rhythm. A true baseline to function from.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can go through periods of months with a set routine, then roll my
          sleep pattern. That can sometimes take a few days to flip around
          again. Normally with teaching when this happened it would be during
          the school holidays, when I didn't have commitments. It didn't always
          happen, but sometimes the results were far from ideal. I have learnt a
          lot about myself, and basic psychology as I delved deeper into this
          stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
          The two main things to prevent this are: A set end time for work, that
          allows some time to relax or chill out, and a discipline about a max
          bed time, with a proper wind down ( ie no phone or sleep hygiene as
          they call it ). The other less obvious factor I have found is reigning
          in my FOMO ( fear of missing out ), especially with friends who's only
          hobbys are video games etc. I can't practically keep up with these
          things ( I have a competitive nature around these things, that doesn't
          spill over into real life anywhere near this videogame level.).
        </p>
      </article>
      <h3>Core growth</h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          I have done a lot of work on myself over the years, and much of it was
          in this area. That said there's always room to improve. I'd like to
          keep a stoic head whilst being an empathetic person. I'm always
          looking to build upon my communication skills. I can sometimes do with
          reading the room a little better. I'll need to develop my professional
          communication and skills around these areas, as it's been a while
          since I've had an 'office job'.
        </p>
      </article>
      <h3>My commitment to Dev Academy</h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          My main commitment to this programme in general is to give it my all
          in effort, commitment and applying myself as best I can. This includes
          working around my strengths and weaknesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will treat everyone with respect. I will strive to keep all
          interractions comfortable, friendly and productive. I believe the main
          way to do this will be by sharing our goals, in general and for the
          intteraction. Whether that is peer coding, a lesson, or generally
          hanging out, the ideal outcome is having an underlining layer of
          respect and integrity with everything we do at Dev Academy.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will reach out for help if things are building up, and I can't deal
          with them. I normally deal with build ups by getting outside, doing
          exercise, taking a break and or generally taking a moment to reflect.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will seek help if I'm stuck for 20-30mins or more, I will ask via my
          cohort or facilitators, where ever I think will give the best result.
          Generally I'll ask my cohort, or fellow students, unless it's really
          difficult. Normally though the facilitators have already noticed if
          it's a difficult problem.
        </p>
      </article>
      <h3>My expectations for the facilitators</h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          I expect what everyone expects from the facilitation team, for them to
          be fair, and help me when they can. To be clear about expectations,
          and communications around important topics.
        </p>
      </article>
      <h3>My schedule</h3>
      <p>
        For the most part my scheduling is very open for this course, I do have
        some prior commitments seen below:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Mondays: 7pm sometimes a last miniute rehearsal for Airforce band.
        </li>
        <li>Tuesdays: 6:30pm a lesson. 8-9:30/10pm Drumline (Airforce).</li>
        <li>
          Wednesday: 6:30pm & 7:30pm 2 back to back lessons at different
          locations.
        </li>
        <li>Thursdays: 6:30-8pm Group lessons</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Apart from that I am very free, and I can also move or cancel some of
        those if needs be.
