      <article>
        <p>
          My long term goal is to get to the point of being able to contract on
          my terms. I see the career pathway as learning through this course,
          then starting out as a an intern / junior developer, learning the
          ropes and slowly climbing the ladder. My main goal is to be good
          enough to contract within 5 years after this course.

      <h3>My strengths and limitations</h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          My strengths when it comes to learning, are mainly around the goals
          and motivation of watning to learn this stuff, bringing a dedication
          and commitment. I can analyse things to a certain extent, I'm hoping
          this will help me learn things faster and on a deeper level.
        </p>
        <p>
          My limitations when it comes to learning are: Primarily about time
          management, self discipline, and routine. I have lot's of room to
          grown with time management / scheduling etc. I have strong self
          discipline, but when it's related to routine or keeping one I am more
          lax than I should be.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main thing is routine, this is my biggest hurdle, creating new
          habits and keeping them. Life for me has never had a truly set
          routine, it's always changed depending on what I was doing. There is
          always the posibility of a last minute call to a gig with a late start
          / end time. That won't change as much, but the main factor is
          developing a consistent circadian rhythm. A true baseline to function
          from.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can go through periods of months with a set routine, then roll my
          sleep pattern. That can sometimes take a few days to flip around agin.
          Normally with teaching when this happened it would be during the
          school holidays, when I didn't have commitments. It didn't always
          happen, but sometimes the results were far from ideal. I have learnt a
          lot about myself, and basic psychology as I delved deeper into this
          stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 2 main things to prevent this are a set end time for work, that
          allows some time to relax or chill out, and a discipline about a max
          bed time, with a proper wind down ( ie no phone or sleep hygiene as
          they call it ). The other less obvious factor I have found is reinging
          in my FOMO ( fear of missing out ), especially with friends who's only
          hobbys are video games etc, I can't practically keep up with these
          things ( I have a competitive nature around these things, that doesn't
          spill over into real life anywhere to this level.).

        <p>
          I have done a lot of work on myself over the years, and much of it was
          in this area. That said there's always room to improve. I'd like to
          keep a stoic head whilst being an empathetic person. I'm always
          looking to build upon my communication skills. I can sometimes do with
          reading the room a little better. I'll need to develop my professional
          communication and skills around these areas, as it's been a while
          since I've had an 'office job'.
