      <h3 class="left">My Goal</h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          My long term goal is to get to the point of being able to contract on
          my terms. I see the career pathway as learning through this course,
          then starting out as a an intern / junior developer, learning the
          ropes and slowly climbing the ladder. My main goal is to be good
          enough to contract within 5 years after this course.

      <h3>My strengths and limitations</h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          My strengths when it comes to learning, are mainly around the goals
          and motivation of wanting to learn this stuff, bringing a dedication
          and commitment. I can analyse things to a certain extent, I'm hoping
          this will help me learn things faster, and on a deeper level.
        </p>
        <p>
          My limitations when it comes to learning are primarily about time
          management, self discipline, and routine. I have lot's of room to
          grown with time management / scheduling etc. I have strong self
          discipline, but when it's related to routine or keeping one, I am more
          lax than I should be.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main thing is routine, this is my biggest hurdle, creating new
          habits and keeping them. Life for me has never had a truly set
          routine, it's always changed depending on what I was doing. There is
          always the posibility of a last minute call, a gig with a late start /
          end time. That won't change as much, but the main factor is developing
          a consistent circadian rhythm. A true baseline to function from.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can go through periods of months with a set routine, then roll my
          sleep pattern. That can sometimes take a few days to flip around
          again. Normally with teaching when this happened it would be during
          the school holidays, when I didn't have commitments. It didn't always
          happen, but sometimes the results were far from ideal. I have learnt a
          lot about myself, and basic psychology as I delved deeper into this
          stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
          The two main things to prevent this are: A set end time for work, that
          allows some time to relax or chill out, and a discipline about a max
          bed time, with a proper wind down ( ie no phone or sleep hygiene as
          they call it ). The other less obvious factor I have found is reigning
          in my FOMO ( fear of missing out ), especially with friends who's only
          hobbys are video games etc. I can't practically keep up with these
          things ( I have a competitive nature around these things, that doesn't
          spill over into real life anywhere near this videogame level.).

      <h3>Core growth</h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          I have done a lot of work on myself over the years, and much of it was
          in this area. That said there's always room to improve. I'd like to
          keep a stoic head whilst being an empathetic person. I'm always
          looking to build upon my communication skills. I can sometimes do with
          reading the room a little better. I'll need to develop my professional
          communication and skills around these areas, as it's been a while
          since I've had an 'office job'.
        </p>

      <h3>My commitment to Dev Academy</h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          My main commitment to this programme in general is to give it my all
          in effort, commitment and applying myself as best I can. This includes
          working around my strengths and weaknesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will treat everyone with respect. I will strive to keep all
          interractions comfortable, friendly and productive. I believe the main
          way to do this will be by sharing our goals, in general and for the
          intteraction. Whether that is peer coding, a lesson, or generally
          hanging out, the ideal outcome is having an underlining layer of
          respect and integrity with everything we do at Dev Academy.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will reach out for help if things are building up, and I can't deal
          with them. I normally deal with build ups by getting outside, doing
          exercise, taking a break and or generally taking a moment to reflect.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will seek help if I'm stuck for 20-30mins or more, I will ask via my
          cohort or facilitators, where ever I think will give the best result.
          Generally I'll ask my cohort, or fellow students, unless it's really
          difficult. Normally though the facilitators have already noticed if
          it's a difficult problem.
        </p>
      </article>
      <h3>My expectations for the facilitators</h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          I expect what everyone expects from the facilitation team, for them to
          be fair, and help me when they can. To be clear about expectations,
          and communications around important topics.
        </p>
      </article>
      <h3>My schedule</h3>
      <p>
        For the most part my scheduling is very open for this course, I do have
        some prior commitments seen below:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Mondays: 7pm sometimes a last miniute rehearsal for Airforce band.
        </li>
        <li>Tuesdays: 6:30pm a lesson. 8-9:30/10pm Drumline (Airforce).</li>
        <li>
          Wednesday: 6:30pm & 7:30pm 2 back to back lessons at different
          locations.
        </li>
        <li>Thursdays: 6:30-8pm Group lessons</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Apart from that I am very free, and I can also move or cancel some of
        those if needs be.
