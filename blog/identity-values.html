      <h3>Values verse beliefs?</h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          Values are an interesting subject, they are or can be subjective, what
          seperates them from belief or beliefs, how can you accurately gauge
          these things. Can you truly self reflect or analyse, to what level?
          Can you truly identify your values or are your values more like an
          opinion. How you see your self, how you would like to see your self,
          how you truly are, how other people see you, or maybe how you would
          like to be seen? Your actions, your reactions, your experience /
          experiences what you've chosen / what you've had to or just have
          experienced, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Things I'd like to believe I value are - honestly, competency,
          curiosity, respect, love, integriy, commitment / heart,
          responsibility, trust, creativity and truth. This is just scratching
          the surface, if I look at a list of values I indentify with a lot of
          them. Also not having a set limit somewhat makes this even more
          difficult, although I guess narrowing it down is also similar, and
          it's been hinted to provide evidence for these values. So upon reading
          <a

            >this</a
          >, this exercise started to make a little more sense to me, though I
          don't think I'll truly get to the bottom of this without far more time
          spent.

          A story from highschool that relates, or related to my integrity and
          honesty. I was 18 at Welington High School when I found a $20 note at
          lunch time, I wondered what to do, but I ended up handing it in to the
          office. I can tell you most of my friends would not have done the
          same. Hillariously it actually got back to the rightful owner and I
          met them at a party years later, they knew my name as well and I'd
          never met them, small Wellington as they say.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I were to think about an achievement I'm proud of, it would
          probably be my degree / bachelors in jazz performance. At the same
          time, I also didn't really care about the piece of paper, but have
          found it hasn't exactly hindered me, especially when it came to
          teaching.
        </p>
        <p>
          A quote that I like to live by is "You miss 100% of the shots you
          don't take." Also "Expect everything and anything is nothing, expect
          nothing and anything is everything." There are lots of great quotes
          and many I relate to but these come to me straight off the top of my
          head, without needing to find them.

      <h3>My Strengths</h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          Well I have taken the big 5.
          <a
            class="active current"
            href="https://psytests.org/result?v=ipin1Yr8bwW3cKtG"
          >
            this</a
          >
          result seems to somewhat reflect how I see my self, whether accurate
          or not is obviously another question entirely. Althought this test has
          a lot of what I would personally consider, negative connotations, that
          do not necessarily reflect reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through my own personal development I can tell you that my strengths
          are changing lenses, being persistent and trying to get the most out
          of what I'm doing.
        </p>
        <h3 class="center">My weaknesses</h3>
        <!-- Aligns left? No idea why, look when have time, maybe week 6.-->
        <p>
          My Weaknesses are viewing the whole thing or big picture. Say when I
          was at university I would think about writing the entire essay and all
          that that entailed even though logically I knew, just write a
          paragraph a day, just get something started etc. My default was to
          view the whole task then be overwhelmed. I obviously was able to
          overcome this, and would just write anything, then eventually got a
          frame work / system, start writing a draft remind my self it doesn't
          matter how bad it is I can always make it better etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can tend to be harsh with my words at times, not is a nasty way but
          in a cut through to the core issue or point. Over the years I have
          learnt more EQ and how to communicate feelings and in more suitable
          tones when necessary.
        </p>

      <h3>Ethical decision</h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          There is the money story above. I didn't weigh up the values I just
          did what I believed was right. I reflect positively on it, and would
          like to believe I'd make the same or similar decision again, though
          times have changed and unfortunately, money is far more necessary. I
          would like to think I'd still make the same decision.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another situation that probably works better for this prompt, though I
          feel massive cringe telling it ( and haven't thought of a better one
          yet!!), would be the decision to end a relationship.
          <br />
          I had realised we didn't make each other happy, and I think we were
          both together because neither of us wanted to be alone, we were
          cruising on the attraction to each other. I think part of the problem
          was on paper we were a successful realtionship, or at least we thought
          so.
        </p>
        <p>
          I weighed up many angles, beliefs & values from commitment, to truth,
          and what I think we both held onto the most, love.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pros were definitely in favour in the long run, but in the short
          run it seemd like a loss, and well, it was. I decidied to start
          talking about things we hadn't really discussed - kids, where we would
          end up living, what I'd need to earn etc. I also brought up stuff we
          had been mulling over, I knew these talks would most likely kill the
          relationship, and that was part of the problem. The fact that these
          important talks had never really occured, and even worse that they
          could destroy the relationship. There was no real foundation. Looking
          back it's so obvious, but at the time, inside it, it felt real,
          important, strong.
          <br />
          Ultimately this discussion did lead to the end of the realtionship,
          though I had hoped it would have ended on better terms than it did at
          the time.
        </p>
        <p>
          I reflect positively on the decision now, we didn't end on the best
          note then but we are are on better terms now,
          <em>but that took years.</em> As it quite often does.
        </p>
        <p>
          I honestly think we should have broken up earlier, but everything is
          always easier in hindsight, and you don't know what you don't know.
          Let alone the main point that neither of us really wanted to face
          reality, and that be can easier to avoid then one might think ( at
          least in my experience ).

      <h3>My culture, and its influence</h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          I suppose a cultural aspect that has influenced me was that from age
          like 9 or something, I was allowed a little glass of wine with dinner.
          This led me to never feeling like I wasn't aloud to drink, and I
          barely went through the crazy drinking stages most of my friends did.
          I say barely because I'd be lieing if I said I didn't have the odd
          party night when I drunk far more than I should have.
        </p>
      </article>
      <h3>The strengths to guide my journey</h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          My main strengths are drawn from studying music, I have a true
          understanding of how I'll never know everything and I can always learn
          more. This will help me stay focussed and never get an ego.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another strength will be looking at problems from multiple angles, and
          the humility to realise I might have in fact overlooked something
          increadibly basic. This will help me solve and trouble shoot problems
          and interactions.
        </p>
      </article>
      <h3>My limitations</h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          I will need to be more consistent in terms of even circadian rhythm.
          I'm already working on this, but this will help me in many ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though aware of it, I will need to make sure I tackle problems with
          the right framework, and avoid trying to look at the whole problem if
          it is unrealistic.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will need to take breaks, and make sure I actually <em>do</em>, as I
          can get fixated and focus too much on something, this can also make me
          irritable if I'm itterupted, which can be added to if I haven't eaten
          properly.
        </p>
      </article>
      <h3>Conflict resolution</h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          I've had numerous experiences like this, some even in drumline. One
          time there was a lot of resistance around doing something a particular
          way. I outlined some of the reasons why I thought we should do it this
          way, and even entertained a vote. Another time I had to ask for
          clarification from, I guess you'd call them management. I think the
          management stragey should be a last resort most of the time. I found
          explaining why to most people helps, and also where possible letting
          people have an input like a vote or feed back / a chance to voice
          their concerns, these were the most effective strategies in my
          opinion.
        </p>
      </article>
      <h3>Final reflection</h3>
      <p>
        It is interesting to look at this from an outside perspective, I've
        really looked deeply into my strengths and weaknesses, but I've never
        really delved into values much. I have obviously looked into beliefs,
        outlooks, lense's etc and well you could argue values sit in that.
      </p>
      <p>There's always more to learn as they say.</p>
