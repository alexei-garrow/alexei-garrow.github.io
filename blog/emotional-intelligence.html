      <h3>What is Emotional intelligence?</h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          From the oxford dictionary: "the capacity to be aware of, control, and
          express one's emotions, and to handle interpersonal relationships
          judiciously and empathetically. "emotional intelligence is the key to
          both personal and professional success""
        </p>
        <p>
          A lot of definitions are very similar to this: "Emotional Intelligence
          (EI) is the ability to manage both your own emotions and understand
          the emotions of people around you. There are five key elements to EI:
          self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social
          skills." From Mental Health America.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main themes are:
          <ol class="center">
            <li>Self-awareness</li>
            <li>self-management or self-regulation</li>
            <li>Motivation ( though some definitions leave this out..)</li>
            <li>Empathy ( some
              also miss this out and or phrase it differently )</li>
              <li>social skills or social
                awareness, and or relationship management.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>A lot of the benefits are said to be around having lower levels or stress, being less emotionally reactive and being more aware of the people around you and your impact on each other.  
        </p>
        <p>The way I personally see emotional inteligence or EQ is like a person who aims to be stoic ( stoicism ), whilst also being able to 'read' body language. Emotional inteligence is thought to be a learned skill. Though some people will start at different levels, especially with aspects of reading peoples moods feelings etc.</p>
        <p>
          Body language, like EQ gets a bad wrap. The problem is the assumptions about these things. If we were to really break down the idea of EQ to it's root, you are simply aiming to be more aware. This awareness is then focussed on not just you, but your emotions, your reactions, how you make people feel and how people make you feel. Really it's a form of self realization, self anaylization and self actualization.
        </p>
        <p>"self-actualization, in psychology, a concept regarding the process by which an individual reaches his or her full potential. It was originally introduced by Kurt Goldstein, a physician specializing in neuroanatomy and psychiatry in the early half of the 20th century."

          <a class="active current" target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/science/self-actualization.">https://www.britannica.com/science/self-actualization.</a>
          </p>
          <p>These concepts all have psychological conceptualizations. There is heavy debate as to whether one can really or truly 'Self Analyse'. The main point though, is you never know until you try, and if you truly believe something to be impossible, then it will be. ( <a class="active current" target="_blank" href="https://www.betterup.com/blog/what-are-limiting-beliefs#:~:text=A%20limiting%20belief%20is%20a,how%20you%20interact%20with%20people.">link</a> ).
          </p>
          <p>Without getting into limiting beliefs, and how they can become actual neural pathways in your <a class="active current" target="_blank" href="https://www.davinia.org.uk/articles-and-downloads/limiting-beliefs-summary.html#:~:text=Each%20neural%20pathway%20gets%20physically,become%20second%20nature%20to%20you.">brain</a><em> No that's not a peer reviewed link, just a basic summary of practical informaiton, feel free to delve deeper into this stuff, I found the experience very rewarding.</em></p>
        <p>
          A lot of this stuff relates to how we learn, mainly through the basic process of repition, to our outlook and even our understanding of how memories, processes and 'muscle memeory' are created. With a greater understanding of how we react, and how our emotions effect our actions. We can have greater control over our lives.
        </p>
        <p>What about relating to other people, what about body language. Though quite often given a bad wrap body languge can be a great thing to look into. The problems that arise from body language, are much like the rest of our lives. People unconciously adding our biases and outlooks to things, that don't necesserally reflect reality. Though studies by Dr Paul Ekman can prove that micro expressions ( emotions that flash across our faces at around a 1/5th of a second.) are unconcious, and uncontrollable. That doesn't nessecearry mean we can read them. Just because someone flashes anger when you ask them something, doesn't mean they are actually relating that emotion to what you said, they could be thinking about something else, or have a different perception of what you've said, a different lense if you will.</p>
        <p>So why waste time learning this stuff if you can't know everyone's secrets!? Well sometimes we can know they are feeling a particular emotion, when we get a sense for someone we can start to tell something might be bothering them, or that they might not agree with something we've said. The real use of this is not to assume or learn all their secrets, it's to know that it could be worth enquiring more if we want to know what they really think. The safest way to get a sense something might be up is to go by 3 different sections of the body: The tone voice, mainly the tone of the voice, the face it's expressions & emotions, and the body ( arms crossed, facing away, feet pointed away etc). If you get a sense that all 3 of these areas are teling you something it can be worth asking about. You can of course dig deeper into all of these areas of body language, though remember even the best readers of people need absolutely controlled situations and environments, and even then they can only be about 70% sure of something. </p>

        <h3 class="center">How is EQ different to IQ.</h3>
        <p class="main2">If we were to google this we can get various answers like: "For a long time, IQ was believed to be the ultimate measure for success in careers and life in general, but there are studies that show a direct relation between higher EQ and successful professionals. People with high EQ generally achieve more, excel at teamwork and service and take more initiative." <a class="active current main2" target="_blank" href="https://www.diffen.com/difference/EQ_vs_IQ#:~:text=For%20a%20long%20time%2C%20IQ,service%20and%20take%20more%20initiative.">https://www.diffen.com/difference/EQ_vs_IQ#:~:text=For%20a%20long%20time%2C%20IQ,service%20and%20take%20more%20initiative.</a>
        </p>
        <p class="main2">Or: "Type of ability: Your EQ refers to your emotional abilities and social skills, including cognitive empathy, emotional regulation, and motivation. Conversely, IQ measures your cognitive and intellectual skills, like working memory, analytical thinking, and knowledge retention."

          <a class="main2 active current " target="_blank" href="https://www.betterup.com/blog/eq-vs-iq#:~:text=Type%20of%20ability%3A%20Your%20EQ,analytical%20thinking%2C%20and%20knowledge%20retention.">https://www.betterup.com/blog/eq-vs-iq#:~:text=Type%20of%20ability%3A%20Your%20EQ,analytical%20thinking%2C%20and%20knowledge%20retention.</a></p>
        <p>Whilst we've explored EQ is about analysing and understand emotions, relationships, outlooks etc.</p>
        <p>
          IQ is primarily thought of as a measurement of inteligence. TO be more specific IQ is <em>meant</em> to be a measurement of things you've never seen before like patterns, problems, etc, and your ability and speed to comeplete tasks based around these. Here's where it gets a little more complicated. There is heavy debate around IQ even in the psychological community. One aspect that <em>could</em> be the case is IQ being fixed. As in, you wouldn't be able to increase it, it would be a set thing that could never be improved. This is where knowledge was seperated from IQ. Knowledge is quite often, at least colloquially thought of as inteligence, but not as IQ. 
        </p>
        <p>IQ is measured through tests realiting to STEM ( science technology engineering and mathmatics ). The truth is that is also and ovbiously has to include language. Most IQ tests are English based, and involve problems that are sometimes worded in difficult ways, or ways to analyse how you perceive things.</p>
        <p>Though whether IQ is set or not, it is now considered generally that you can increase your IQ score, by studying patterns, mathmatics, engineering, physics and in most cases English. Some report to have increased their IQ scores by over 30 points from doing studying these topics.</p>
        <p>The biggest IQ studys are actually not by the Psychological departments at universities, but by the American military. They have their own test developed around this though it now isn't classified technically as an IQ test the ASVAB is a test developed off the iq model, and really it is an iq test. The ASVAB gives people their job options availible, determined by the scores they recieve. This also has a low cut off for example the US Army has a cut of 31 on the ASVAB or around 90-92 on an iq test. ( it's believed this used to be 80iq). This gave psychologists more reason to believe that IQ might be fixed if even the US military couldn't find a use for people with the lower IQ scores, and gave up on training them.</p>
        <p>The truth is we still don't know enough about the brain to say this is true, and even if it currently is that doesn't mean it will always be so, especially if / when we devlop technology related to nanites etc.</p>
        <p>All this said, it turns out 'prodigies' achieve because of photographic or hightened memory more than IQ, and successful leaders and workers tend to be more succesful because of EQ. Whislt IQ might have it's importance place in very niche fields, you can still 'improve' in it if you so wish, even if only for the test. EQ is equally, if not more important for you to study, especially if you are studying to succeed ( at least in my opinion).</p>

      <h3>Why is EQ important.</h3>
      <article>
        <p>Once we have a basic understanding of this stuff ( our emotions, body language etc), this is where EQ really comes into play. If you get the sense someone might not be telling you how they really feel about an activity or problem, should you stand them up in a meeting and yell at them for not being truthful? Probably not, the more you get to know and learn about people the more you know can find the best ways to approach these things.
          Sometimes there might not be a best way, but there will still be a best of the worst options.</p>
        <p>I'm taking a guess that this is part of the reason for us to focus on, and publish our values etc. Not only to relate to ourselves, but to be able to relate to one another better, to get an idea on how to best communicate, disagree and interact with one another. Added by the overall values that Dev Academy strives to keep of integrity, kindness, and effort, it becomes more obvious how learning this will help us not only with and at Dev Academy, but also the rest of our lives.</p>
