      <h3>What is Emotional intelligence?</h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          From the oxford dictionary: "the capacity to be aware of, control, and
          express one's emotions, and to handle interpersonal relationships
          judiciously and empathetically. "emotional intelligence is the key to
          both personal and professional success""
        </p>
        <p>
          A lot of definitions are very similar to this: "Emotional Intelligence
          (EI) is the ability to manage both your own emotions and understand
          the emotions of people around you. There are five key elements to EI:
          self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social
          skills." From Mental Health America.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main themes are:
          <ol>
            <li>Self-awareness</li>
            <li>self-management or self-regulation</li>
            <li>Motivation ( though some definitions leave this out..)</li>
            <li>Empathy ( some
              also miss this out and or phrase it differently )</li>
              <li>social skills or social
                awareness, and or relationship management.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>A lot of the benefits are said to be around having lower levels or stress, being less emotionally reactive and being more aware of the people around you and your impact on each other.  
        </p>
        <p>The way I personally see emotional inteligence or EQ is like a person who aims to be stoic ( stoicism ), whilst also being able to 'read' body language. Emotional inteligence is thought to be a learned skill. Though some people will start at different levels, especially with aspects of reading peoples moods feelings etc.</p>

        <h3 class="center">My weaknesses</h3>
        <p>
          My Weaknesses are viewing the whole thing or big picture. Say when I
          was at university I would think about writing the entire essay and all
          that that entailed even though logically I knew, just write a
          paragraph a day, just get something started etc. My default was to
          view the whole task then be overwhelmed. I obviously was able to
          overcome this, and would just write anything, then eventually got a
          frame work / system, start writing a draft remind my self it doesn't
          matter how bad it is I can always make it better etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can tend to be harsh with my words at times, not is a nasty way but
          in a cut through to the core issue or point. Over the years I have
          learnt more EQ and how to communicate feelings and in more suitable
          tones when necessary.

      <h3>My culture, and its influence</h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          I suppose a cultural aspect that has influenced me was that from age
          like 9 or something, I was allowed a little glass of wine with dinner.
          This led me to never feeling like I wasn't aloud to drink, and I
          barely went through the crazy drinking stages most of my friends did.
          I say barely because I'd be lieing if I said I didn't have the odd
          party night when I drunk far more than I should have.

      <h3>The strengths to guide my journey</h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          My main strengths are drawn from studying music, I have a true
          understanding of how I'll never know everything and I can always learn
          more. This will help me stay focussed and never get an ego.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another strength will be looking at problems from multiple angles, and
          the humility to realise I might have in fact overlooked something
          increadibly basic. This will help me solve and trouble shoot problems
          and interactions.

      <h3>Conflict resolution</h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          I've had numerous experiences like this, some even in drumline. One
          time there was a lot of resistance around doing something a particular
          way. I outlined some of the reasons why I thought we should do it this
          way, and even entertained a vote. Another time I had to ask for
          clarification from, I guess you'd call them management. I think the
          management stragey should be a last resort most of the time. I found
          explaining why to most people helps, and also where possible letting
          people have an input like a vote or feed back / a chance to voice
          their concerns, these were the most effective strategies in my
          opinion.

      <h3>Final reflection</h3>
      <p>
        It is interesting to look at this from an outside perspective, I've
        really looked deeply into my strengths and weaknesses, but I've never
        really delved into values much. I have obviously looked into beliefs,
        outlooks, lense's etc and well you could argue values sit in that.
      </p>
      <p>There's always more to learn as they say.</p>
